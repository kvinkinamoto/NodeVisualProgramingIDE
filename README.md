# NodeVisualProgramingIDE
An open-source IDE for local file handling and code analysis, enabling easy node generation and search functionalities. Developers can work with various programming languages without additional setup. Join the project to contribute through Issues, Discussions, and Pull Requests. Detailed docs available on the Wiki.

1. Core Functional Requirements:

Node System:

Creation and editing of projects using nodes.
Code generation based on nodes for any programming language.
Ability to generate nodes from existing code (code-to-node transformation).
Option to select a programming language for code generation.
Each node has inputs and outputs for parameters (connecting to other nodes).
Customization:

Ability to customize the style of nodes.
Create and import custom node templates.
Flexibility to change the appearance and behavior of nodes.
Project Structure Creation:

Ability to create folders, files, and project structure through nodes.
Code placement in corresponding files without manually creating folder structures.
Code Analysis:

Analyzing existing code to automatically generate nodes.
Searching the code and transforming it into an understandable node structure.
User Interface:

Easy-to-use visual editor for working with nodes.
Intuitive interface for creating and connecting nodes.
Ability to connect nodes to each other via inputs and outputs.
Interactivity:

Add an interactive prototype for testing the functionality of nodes.
Visualize the code generation process in real-time.
2. Technical Requirements:

Technologies:

Frontend: React or Vue.js for building the user interface, using libraries like React Flow or D3.js to implement the node system.
Backend: Node.js or Python for code analysis and interaction with nodes. Ability to integrate with various programming languages.
Database: PostgreSQL or Neo4j to store node and data structures.
Cross-Platform: Use Electron for creating a cross-platform desktop application.
Programming Language Analyzer:

Use libraries for code parsing, such as Babel for JavaScript or LibCST for Python, to ensure code-to-node transformation.
Ability to create custom parsers for new languages if necessary.
Code Generation:

Automatic code generation from nodes for a selected programming language.
Support for multiple programming languages.
Ability to add new languages through plugins or extensions.
3. User Interface and Interaction:

Visual Node Editor:

Easy-to-use interface for building connections between nodes.
Drag-and-drop support for quick node placement.
Color schemes to help identify different node types (input, output, functional, etc.).
Feedback Interface:

Ability for users to leave comments or contact developers via a feedback form.
Simplified registration and participation process for developers in the project.
4. Project Development:

Open Source:

The project should be open source, available for contributions and improvement by the community.
Documentation: Clear documentation explaining how to work with the node system, how to add new programming languages, and create node templates.
5. User Capabilities:

Interface Customization:

Users can modify the interface style and appearance of nodes to adapt the environment to their needs.
Create and Add New Languages:

The community can create new programming languages for code generation via the node system.
6. Deployment and Launch:

Ease of IDE Setup:

Developers should be able to launch the IDE on their computers without complex setup procedures.
Support for Local Files:

The IDE should allow working with local files without requiring constant server connections.
7. Security and Stability:

Security:

Itâ€™s important to ensure security when working with local files and users' projects.
Stability:

Use testing and debugging to ensure the stable operation of the IDE.
